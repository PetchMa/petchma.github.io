                        Opening up a blank canvas is probably the most exciting feeling I've experienced.
                         Making art has reliably made me feel truly free both intellectually and creatively.
                         Unfortunately, I constantly struggle 
                        to find time for it (almost entirely because of school), I'm always making up for the lost time. 
                        Below is a small fraction of a few pieces I did back when I was a kid and some recent ones.

                                I tend to paint weird/surreal type paintings and wanted to test my 
                                fundamentals. Wanted to express a feeling of relief similar to the feeling of being saved 
                                in a storm. 
                            </p>

                                In my opinions one of the greatest defining failures of 
                                totalitarian regimes lay in the ruins of Chernobyl. 
                                A lie was told and now it will rain invisible bullets for the next 40,000 years.  
                            </p>

                                This painting is almost ~ 5 foot tall. At this point in life I felt "unfinished" I felt like there 
                                was much to learn in life yet school and society was telling me to HURRY UP and just grow up already! 
                                Thankfully I never truly did.  
                            </p>

                                As a 6th grader I used to read a lot about history. I've always been at awe at the power 
                                of human ingenuity. The impossible engineering, the fight for good even at the face of death, and the 
                                awesomeness of culture and history. I felt like it ought to be celebrated.

                            <p>
                                This painting is almost ~ 5 foot long. This was a painting hung up in my elementary school. 
                                And is meant to celebrate the teachings given by people before me.

                            <p>
                                This painting is also almost ~ 5 foot long. I had a huge hatred to dictators and the 
                                failures of society in the early 1900's. I wanted to justify that eventually humanity 
                                came through despite the death.

                                Lol I didn't finish this painting. I had to do this to apply to an art high school. 
                                I hate still life's. Literally lifeless but hey it's supposed to show my technique?? ew.
