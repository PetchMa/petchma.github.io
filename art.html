                        Art has always been a source of great freedom for me, both intellectually and creatively. 
                        Sadly, I often struggle to find the time for it—mostly due to school. Below are a few of my paintings, a mix of pieces from when I was a kid and some recent ones. Slowly getting back to it...

                                I tend to paint weird/surreal type paintings and wanted to test my 
                                fundamentals. 
                                Wanted to express a feeling of relief similar to the feeling of being saved 
                                in a storm.

                                I was a werid 6th grader who had a thing for history?
                                I've always been at awe at the power 
                                of human ingenuity. 
                                The impossible engineering, the fight for good even at the face of death, and how 
                                remarkable culture and history is. I felt like it ought to be "celebrated".

                                Chernobyl was not a good time. I quickly painted a place 
                                uninhabitable for the next 40,000 years.

                                This was a painting hung up in my elementary school. 
                                And is meant to celebrate the fruit of teachings given to me by people before me.

                                I had a huge thing with dictators and the 
                                failures of society in the early 1900's. 
                                I wanted to justify that eventually humanity 
                                came through despite the death. I was a weird 12 yr old.
